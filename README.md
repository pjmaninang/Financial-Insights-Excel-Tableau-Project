# Financial Customer Insights & Risk Metrics - Excel/Tableau Project

## Project Overview

This financial institution was seeking a comprehensive analysis of its customers throughout the 2010s, using a transaction-focused dataset. The provided data encompasses a substantial volume of customer transactions over the decade, supplemented by key customer profile attributes. Through detailed analysis and visualization, this project uncovers actionable insights into customer value, spending behavior, and financial risk, enabling the institution to inform strategic decision-making, optimize customer engagement, and identify opportunities for growth.

Using Excel Power Query to clean the data, and Tableau for visualization, insights and recommendations were focused on these objectives:

- Identify the most valuable customer segments by state, age group, and transaction behavior, using metrics such as total customers, average spending per customer, and total transaction counts
- Compare spending patterns and transaction volumes across different age groups to uncover high-value demographics and potential growth opportunities
- Assess customer financial health using Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios and credit utilization levels segmented by credit score brackets
- Highlight customers exceeding healthy credit utilization thresholds to pinpoint areas of potential credit risk and inform mitigation strategies

An interactive Tableau dashboard of the dataset can be found and downloaded [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pj.maninang/viz/SyntheticFinancialTransactions/FinancialInsightsDashboard)

The cleaned excel file used to combine some of the raw data files can be found [here](https://github.com/pjmaninang/Financial-Insights-Excel-Tableau-Project/blob/main/Power%20Query%20Cleaned%20Data.xlsx)

## Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

## Findings and Insights

### Customer Distribution & Value Analysis

- California (244), Texas (159), Florida (131), and New York (124) collectively account for over one-quarter of the institution’s U.S. customer base. This concentration highlights a substantial reliance on a few high-population states, making these markets critical to sustaining and expanding overall performance
  - These four states not only lead in customer count but also generate the highest transaction volumes by a significant margin
- Beyond California’s dominance, the majority of customers are concentrated in states spanning from the Central to Eastern U.S., indicating regional market strength in these areas
- Wyoming, Idaho, and both Dakotas represent the smallest market presence, each with six or fewer customers. This extremely limited footprint suggests untapped market potential, where even modest growth initiatives could deliver proportionally large percentage gains in customer acquisition
- Rhode Island ($766K), Colorado ($662K), and Virginia ($630K) achieve the highest average spend per customer nationwide, despite each having fewer than 50 customers — suggesting potential for targeted, high-value customer engagement strategies in these markets

### Spending & Trnasaction Behaviors 

- Customers aged 45–54 and 65+ exhibit the highest average spend per customer at $496K and $500K respectively, suggesting these groups are critical to driving high-value sales despite potentially smaller customer counts
- The 18–24 age group has both the lowest average spend ($193K) and the lowest transaction volume (16K transactions), indicating low engagement and potential missed lifetime value if not nurtured early
- The 45–54 age group leads transaction activity with 3.5M transactions, followed closely by 65+ with 3.1M and 35–44 with 2.8M. This suggests middle-aged and senior customers are the most engaged repeat buyers
- Customers earning $11.9K–$48.4K annually account for over 8.4M transactions—nearly double that of the next highest income bracket—indicating that the institution’s core market lies within lower-to-middle income earners
- The $48.4K–$103.3K bracket generates 4.3M transactions, demonstrating strong purchasing behavior that could be further cultivated with targeted upsell and cross-sell strategies

### Customer Credit Risk Evaluation

- New York, the fourth largest state in terms of customers and transactions has a large average crediti utilization per customer of 182%
